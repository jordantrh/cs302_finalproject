Challenge 4 Summary:

For Challenge 4, beyond the general project development work completed, I have been working on understanding auto-follow mechanics
for drones. Since our project is focused on implementing a "VibeBot" that can follow it's owner around and do tricks, one of the
most important mechanics will be its ability track the movements of an object. Because of the theoretical nature of implementing
deep learning to accomplish this task, most of my focus has been on reading various articles on the subject, diving into 
You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithms on YouTube, and attempting to get various tutorials to work. The seemingly best tutorial I
have found is located at the GitHub https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/yolov8_tracking. I was able to get this tutorial to run and
have been going through it to figure out how everything works, so that our own implementation can be created (which will take much
longer than 6 hours). Included in our final project repository is a file auto-follow-tutorial.ipynb, which is the file that can run the
tutorial when all dependencies are installed. Because of strange issues with my PC and anaconda to get 3rd party code to work, this
took longer than expected. However, the outputs of the jupyter notebook will show that I was able to compile it and complete the 
tutorial.

Challenge 4 Time Log:

General Auto-Follow Research:       ~1.5 hr
YOLO Specific Research:             ~1.5 hr
Tutorial Research:                  ~1.0 hr
"yolo_v8_tracking" Implementation:  ~2.0 hr

Next Plan:

The goal next is to convert the tutorial into something directly applicable to our project. This will mean organizing a dataset of
people in various states of walking to develop a classification model that the drone could use.

Rubric:

Developing Dataset:                 20
Attempt at Classification Model:    20

Total:                              40
