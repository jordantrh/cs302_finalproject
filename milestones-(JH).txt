Challenge 4 Summary:

For Challenge 4, beyond the general project development work completed, I have been working on understanding auto-follow mechanics
for drones. Since our project is focused on implementing a "VibeBot" that can follow it's owner around and do tricks, one of the
most important mechanics will be its ability track the movements of an object. Because of the theoretical nature of implementing
deep learning to accomplish this task, most of my focus has been on reading various articles on the subject, diving into 
You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithms on YouTube, and attempting to get various tutorials to work. The seemingly best tutorial I
have found is located at the GitHub https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/yolov8_tracking. I was able to get this tutorial to run and
have been going through it to figure out how everything works, so that our own implementation can be created (which will take much
longer than 6 hours). Included in our final project repository is a file tutorial.ipynb, which is the file that can run the
tutorial when all dependencies are installed. Because of strange issues with my PC and anaconda to get 3rd party code to work, this
took longer than expected. If you are wanting to run this for yourself, you will need to follow the steps in the GitHub I just
mentioned. I'm sure you're probably not using a PC, so it'll be smoother (or maybe you are and are just better at this stuff).
